# acamp-search-mobile

This is a mobile React Native application built in order to practice, so just consider it for that purpose.

To consider

- It uses Acamp's API
- Built with Expo
- Empty state and error images are not following the standards of the company.
- The app is not internationalized.

## Dependencies

You need Node.js v10.20.1 or greater https://nodejs.org/es/

## Running the app

Clone the repo and just do:

```
$ npm i

$ npm start
```

or

```
$ yarn

$ yarn start
```

It will open the Expo Developer Tools and there you'll be able to scan the QR code from the Expo Client on your device, or to open the app on your Android/iOS simulator.
